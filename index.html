            <h3>IDPS - Intrusion Detection and Prevention System using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a system in Python that utilizes AI and ML algorithms to detect and repel security attacks 
                in real-time. The system adapts to new threats using data-driven analysis, providing an autonomous security solution.

            <h3>Steganography: Message Encryption Inside Images</h3>
            <p>
                A project implementing steganography to securely hide encrypted messages within digital images, 
                ensuring both confidentiality and the undetectability of the message. 
                This technique allows sensitive information to be concealed within various image formats with minimal impact on image quality.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>RTE-2: Random Timestamp Encryption Using SHA and Unique Hashing</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a custom encryption method, RTE-2, which combines SHA hashing with timestamps to generate unique hashes for identical messages. 
                This ensures that each encryption is distinct even when the same data is input, enhancing security by preventing pattern recognition in encrypted messages.

                Developed a secure messaging app for emergencies, utilizing the RTE-2 custom cryptographic algorithm for encrypted communication. 
                It allows users to broadcast and receive messages on a local network or any IP destination of their choice, scanning and listening 
                on any available port. This tool can be particularly useful during attacks or critical situations, ensuring confidentiality 
                with timestamp-based encryption.

            <p>
                Created a tool to protect sensitive data during a cybersecurity attack by instantly backing up crucial files 
                from the system onto a USB drive. It also scans and identifies important files based on keywords, ensuring 
                the most valuable data is secured first.

            <h3>VAPT - Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing Toolkit</h3>
            <p>
                Designed a powerful, script-driven VAPT toolkit that automates the identification and reporting of network vulnerabilities. 
                This tool not only scans and catalogs security flaws but also integrates with a custom-built analyzer to test remediation options. 
                It simulates parameter changes to evaluate how easily vulnerabilities can be patched or exploited, providing a 
                comprehensive security assessment for strengthening network defenses.

            <h3>Wireshark Traffic and Protocol Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Used Wireshark to analyze and monitor network traffic, gaining insights into TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols. 
                Conducted deep packet inspection, exploring the internal workings of these protocols, identifying patterns, 
                and troubleshooting potential network issues. This hands-on exploration gave me a better understanding of 
                network security and traffic management.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>REST API with Oracle SQL</h3>
            <p>
                Implemented a REST API to interact with an Oracle SQL database for hands-on university project work. 
                This allowed efficient querying, updating, and management of data through a back-end service layer.
