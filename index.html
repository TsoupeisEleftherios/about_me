            <h3>Automated Cybersecurity Mechanisms Using AI (Thesis Project)</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a system in Python that utilizes AI and machine learning algorithms to detect and repel security attacks 
                in real-time. The system adapts to new threats using data-driven analysis, providing an autonomous security solution.

            <h3>Instant Backup USB (IB-USB)</h3>
            <p>
                Created a tool to protect sensitive data during a cybersecurity attack by instantly backing up crucial files 
                from the system onto a USB drive. It also scans and identifies important files based on keywords, ensuring 
                the most valuable data is secured first.

            <h3>Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) Toolkit</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a small script-based toolkit for penetration testing purposes, which helps in identifying 
                vulnerabilities in a network and assessing potential security flaws.

                Used Wireshark to analyze and monitor network traffic, gaining insights into TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols. 
                Conducted deep packet inspection, exploring the internal workings of these protocols, identifying patterns, 
                and troubleshooting potential network issues. This hands-on exploration gave me a better understanding of 
                network security and traffic management.
